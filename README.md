<p><strong>My process</strong></p>

<p> Just downloaded the project directions and started coding. Did a lot of research everytime I got stuck...</p>
<p><strong>Built with </strong></p>
<p>Visual Studio Code for coding and Responsively Web Browser to view the variety of medias and responsiveness</p>
<br>
HTML5 markup | CSS custom properties | Flexbox | Mobile-first workflow
<br>

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p> I learned how to organize the parts <divs> of my project with <strong>flex</strong> and CSS tricks. I also used Responsively Browser<br>
to keep track of the medias the design should fit (eg, mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop screens). Other important point is, Mobile First
Design makes things way easier! </p>

<p> Despite it's a newbie challenge, it took a lot of research and time to accomplish, but I'm happy with the final result. Need to study<br>
more and try as many challenges as I can.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Useful resources</strong></p>
<p> Research done Mostly from W3Schools and StackOverflow</p>
